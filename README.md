# Supabase Auth UI Vue

Supabase Auth UI is a pre-built Vue component for authenticating users. It supports custom themes and extensible styles to match your brand and aesthetic.

This was built as my first step towards contributing to open source and is heavily inspired by [Supabase Auth UI React](https://github.com/supabase/auth-ui/tree/main/packages/react)
